Configuring the Service Principal in Terraform
As we've obtained the credentials for this Service Principal - it's possible to configure them in a few different ways.

When storing the credentials as Environment Variables, for example:

$ export ARM_CLIENT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
$ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
$ export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
$ export ARM_TENANT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
